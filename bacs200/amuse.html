		<h1>Amusing Giggles</h1>
    <p>by Jamie Fleck</p>
      <p>When I am given a few minutes to spare, I enjoy watching funny videos on Instagram. I try to share them with my friends to put a smile on their faces</p>
    	<h2>Favorite Video</h2>
    		<p>I think this video is so funny and quote it quite often in my daily life</p>
	      	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7D2Oq7LDkc">A KNIFE! NO!</a>
	<h2>Most used Hand Gesture</h2>
			<p>I like to use the motions that this "Karen" uses when telling people to calm down.</p>
