			<p>Artificial inteligence is technology that can be programed to help humans with their day to day tasks. Artificial inteligence is very beneficial and can learn and adapt to different data that it comes across. Some benefits of artificial intelligence include error-free processing that can be made/overlooked by a human, it is availiable 24/7 and doesn't need to sleep to function, aand it is very helpful with repetitive jobs. Some cons that come along with this are that it is very costly to make, it increases unemployment and it cannot create anything on its own...meaning it is not creative like humans are.</p>

				<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p> Artificial Intelligence can be used in politics in many different fields. AI has been used by politicians before by studying people's perspectives by employing artificial intelligence and then changing and modifying their own views so they can gain more supporters. AI can also be used to inside government systems to help monitor or detect corruption and can ultimately reduce the cost of some political campaigns.
