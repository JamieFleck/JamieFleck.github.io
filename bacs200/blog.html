			<p>Artificial inteligence is technology that can be programed to help humans with their day to day tasks. Artificial inteligence is very beneficial and can learn and adapt to different data that it comes across. Some benefits of artificial intelligence include error-free processing that can be made/overlooked by a human, it is availiable 24/7 and doesn't need to sleep to function, aand it is very helpful with repetitive jobs. Some cons that come along with this are that it is very costly to make, it increases unemployment and it cannot create anything on its own...meaning it is not creative like humans are.</p>
